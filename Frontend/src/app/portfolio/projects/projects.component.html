        This is a lite-weight learning management system I built with .NET and
        Angular. It's essentially a mock Moodle or D2L website, but with much
        less features. Some key lessons I've learned from developing this site
        are implementing JWTs, JWT claims to associate data with specific users,
        role-based authorized HTTP routes, and general C#/.NET practices like
        using Data Transfer Objects, Automappers, and generics. In addition,
        this project gave me a chance to develop the backend with .NET best
        practices in mind, such as separation of concerns for controller, model,
        data, service, and

        This is a full stack online POS system for a fictional icecream shop
        built with .NET and Angular. Some key lessons I learned from developing
        this site was general Angular practices like utilizing dependency
        injection for services, components vs modules, and utilizing ng methods
        within html. In addition, I learned how to make basic HTTP calls from
        the frontend to backend and how these processes behave (asynchronously).

        This is an online video/chat website I made with ExpressJS, EJS

        This was my first portfolio website that I developed with vanilla
        JavaScript, HTML, SASS, and a hint of PHP. I included it in my list of
        projects because it taught me a lot of fundamental lessons about web
        development, such as why it's a good idea to use styling frameworks such
        as Bootstrap to save time on responsive UI implementations, basic JS DOM
        element manipulation for UX, and handling form submissions with PHP.
